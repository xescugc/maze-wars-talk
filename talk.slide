* Before we start!

It's still under development so bugs can happen and also the sever may not hold, but it's fine, break it :)

Check it on [[https://maze-wars.com]]

* A bit of myself

* Why did I do it

Inspied in a Warcraft 3 mod named "Line Tower Wars"

- GO and [[https://ebitengine.org/][Ebiten]]

* Examples

.code ebiten_go

* First steps

* Code Architecture

Wanted to use [[https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/][Flux]] so I created [[https://github.com/xescugc/go-flux]]

- State Update
- Potential for replaying games

* Summon Units

Pathing evolution:

- Y++
- Dijkstra
- A*
- A* plus

.video units.mp4 video/mp4 300 500

* Pathing with Dijkstra

.video dijkstra.mp4 video/mp4 400 600

* Pathing with A*

.video astar.mp4 video/mp4 400 600

* Place Towers

- Do not block the path
- Attack units

.video towers.mp4 video/mp4 400 600

* Gold, Income and Lives

* Multiplayer Server

- [[https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html][Fast-Paced Multiplayer (Part I): Client-Server Game Architecture]] for documentation reference
- Using Authoritative Server with client prediction
- Websockets for Client<->Server communication
- Server also using Flux

* UX/UI

Migration to [[https://ebitenui.github.io/][Ebitenui]]

- User sign up
- Lobby
- Waiting Room
- Game

* Cross compilation

- Linux
- Darwin
- Windows

Browser with WASM and Android on the future

* Future of Maze Wars

There are still a lot of things to do and improvements:

- Improves A*
- Add more units
- Add more towers
- And much much much much much ... much more
